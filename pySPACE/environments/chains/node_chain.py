This module extends/reimplements the original MDP flow class and
has some additional methods like reset(), save() etc.

Furthermore it supports the construction of NodeChains and
also running them inside nodes in parallel.

class SubflowHandler(object):

    A subflow means a node chain used inside a node for processing data.

    This class provides functions that can be used by nodes to generate and
    execute subflows. It serves thereby as a communication daemon to the
    backend (if it is used).

    Most important when inheriting from this class is that the subclass MUST be
    a node. The reason is that this class uses node functionality, e.g. logging,
    the *temp_dir*-variable and so on.

    **Parameters**

        :processing_modality:
            One of the valid strings: 'backend', 'serial', 'local'.

                :backend:
                    The current backends modality is used. This is implemented
                    at the moment only for 'LoadlevelerBackend' and 'LocalBackend'.

                :serial:
                    All subflows are executed sequentially, i.e. one after the
                    other.

                :local:
                    Subflows are executed in a Pool using *pool_size* cpus. This
                    may be also needed when no backend is used.

            (*optional, default: 'serial'*)

        :pool_size:
            If a parallelization is based on using several processes on a local
            system in parallel, e.g. option 'backend' and
            :class:`pySPACEMulticoreBackend`
            or option
            'local', the number of worker processes for subflow evaluation has
            to be specified.

            .. note:: When using the LocalBackend, there is also the possibility
                      to specify the pool size of parallel executed
                      processes, e.g. data sets. Your total number of cpu's
                      should be pool size (pySPACE) + pool size (subflows).

            (*optional, default: 2*)

        :batch_size:
            If parallelization of subflow execution is done together with the
            :class:`~pySPACE.environments.backends.ll_backend.LoadLevelerBackend`,
            *batch_size* determines how many subflows are executed in one
            serial LoadLeveler job. This option is useful if execution of a
            single subflow is really short (range of seconds) since there is
            significant overhead in creating new jobs.
