""" Example module that can be used with the :mod:`~pySPACE.missions.operations.generic` operation.

This module shows how the mandelbrot set can be computed in a distributed 
fashion. For this, it is required that two module-level
functions are defined: "process" and "consolidate". The actual subpart of 
the computation is  performed by the function "process" (which is called once
for each process) and the function "consolidate" is called once at the end
of an operation and is responsible for merging the results of the
sub-computations into the the overall result.
