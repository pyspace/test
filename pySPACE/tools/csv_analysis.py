""" Deal with csv files in general, and in particular after classification

The functions provided here focus on two issues:

    1) Manipulation of csv files (load, save, change)
    2) Repair csv files after unsuccessful classification,
       e.g. to be able to perform an analysis operation

**Examples**

    1) Loading csv file, extracting relevant data, saving new csv file:

        *Problem*:

        A csv file is existing, but the file is huge and you need only certain
        values, which are all entries with

            - Parameter __Range__=500
            - Parameter __Start__=100
            - Parameter __SamplingFreq__=25

        *Solution*:

        .. code-block:: python

            import csv_analysis
            data=csv_analysis.csv2dict('results.csv')
            conditions=csv_analysis.empty_dict(data)
            conditions['__Range__'].append('500')
            conditions['__Start__'].append('200')
            conditions['__SamplingFreq__'].append('25')
            new_dict=csv_analysis.strip_dict(data, conditions)
            csv_analysis.dict2csv('new_results.csv', new_dict)

    2) Build results.csv after classification failure and complement with reconstructed conditions:

        *Problem*:

        A classification procedure failed or has been aborted. What is needed is a
        procedure that

            (i)     builds a results.csv from conditions that were ready
            (ii)    identifies the conditions which were not ready
            (iii)   reconstructs missing conditions according to parameters inferable
                    from path and user defined default values (e.g. AUC=0.5 and
                    F_measure=0)
            (iv)    merges into existing results and saves.

        *Solution short*:

        .. code-block:: python

            from pySPACE.tools import csv_analysis
            from pySPACE.resources.dataset_defs.performance_result import PerformanceResultSummary
            mydefaults=dict()
            mydefaults['AUC']=0.5
            mydefaults['F_measure']=0
            PerformanceResultSummary.repair_csv(datapath, default_dict=mydefaults)

        *Solution long*:

        .. code-block:: python

            import csv_analysis
            from pySPACE.resources.dataset_defs.performance_result import PerformanceResultSummary
            num_splits=52
            PerformanceResultSummary.merge_performance_results(datapath)
            csv_dict = csv_analysis.csv2dict(datapath + '/results.csv')
            oplist=csv_analysis.check_op_libSVM(datapath)
            failures = csv_analysis.report_failures(oplist, num_splits)
            mydefaults=dict()
            mydefaults['AUC']=0.5
            mydefaults['F_measure']=0
            final_dict=csv_analysis.reconstruct_failures(csv_dict, failures,
                                                num_splits, default_dict=mydefaults)
            csv_analysis.dict2csv(datapath + '/repaired_results.csv', final_dict)

def check_for_failures(data, num_splits, conditions, remove_count=False):
    """ Compute a list of conditions for which the classification failed
    
    Given a possibly incomplete results.csv and a set of parameters as defined
    in an operation.yaml, this function compares all the expected combinations
    of parameters with what has actually been evaluated according to
    results.csv. It returns a list of failures, i.e., a list of dictionaries,
    each representing one combination of parameters for which results are
    missing.
    
    Besides the actual parameters, the dictionaries in failures have one
    additional key 'count'. The value of 'count' is the number of times this
    particular parameter setting occurred in the results file. The expected
    number of occurrences is the number of splits, 'num_splits'. If the
    failures list is to be further used, it might be necessary to remove the
    count key again - if remove_count=True, this will be done automatically.
    
    .. note:: Even though __Dataset__ is not explicitly stated in the
        operation.yaml, this function needs you to specify the collections as
        parameter all the time. See the following example.
    
    .. note:: This implementation is highly inefficient as it just loops through
        the results list and the list of expected parameter settings instead of
        making use of any sophisticated search algorithms. Large problem might
        thus take some time.

    **Parameters**
    
        :data:
            Dictionary as returned by csv2dict. Usually this dictionary should
            contain the (incomplete) analysis results, hence it will in most
            cases be the product of something like csv2dict('results.csv').
        :num_splits:
            Number of splits. The decision if the condition is interpreted as
            failure depends on this parameter.
        :conditions:
            A dictionary containing the parameter ranges as specified in the
            operation.yaml. Additionally, __Dataset__ has to be specified. See
            the following example.
        :remove_count:
            optional: controls if the count variable will be removed from the
            entries in the failures list.

    This works only for libSVM classification with stored results, as it
    relies on files stored in the persistency directories.
    
    This function navigates to input_dir (which is the result directory of the
    classification) and checks the number of files starting with 'features' in
    'persistency_run0/LibSVMClassifierNode/' in each subdirectory. In case the
    classification was successfully performed, the number of files here should
    equal the number of splits used. If not, this is a hint that something

    The list returned by this function contains alternating

    (ii) number of files
