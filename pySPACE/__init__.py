pySPACE API
===========

Welcome to the main module of pySPACE, the Signal Processing And Classification Environment
in Python. For a complete and up-to date documentation we internally refer to
our `webserver <https://websrv.dfki.uni-bremen.de/IMMI/pySPACE/index.html>`_ version
and for external programmers, use the git project webpage.

This module contains the basic imports for using pySPACE and sets the default
configuration.

**Documentation**

Documentation is done with `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
and some helper functions coming with the software for more customization.
The folder that contains all the documentation is called ``docs``.
To compile you first have to install Sphinx 1.1 or a better version.
The documentation can be created by running ``make html`` in the ``docs`` directory
(therefore we have a ``Makefile`` in the ``docs`` folder).
To view the documentation open the ``index.html`` in the ``.build/html`` folder.

**Structure of the Software and First Steps**

This software is structured into six main parts on the top level which give you a hint of 
where you might like to go. pySPACE is a highly modular framework, so all possible
tasks and algorithms are called :mod:`~pySPACE.missions`, input and output are defined
as :mod:`~pySPACE.resources`.

To start the software, go to the :mod:`~pySPACE.run` package, to get an idea of
what you can do, see the documentation of :mod:`~pySPACE.missions` (nodes and operations) 
and the documentation in :ref:`getting_started`, the :ref:`overview` and maybe some :ref:`tutorials`.

**Where to Go to Integrate Your Own Extensions**

If you want to integrate your own application, you will probably have to create new
:mod:`~pySPACE.missions`. If your algorithm can handle single :mod:`~pySPACE.resources.data_types`
or only works with one :mod:`dataset <pySPACE.resources.dataset_defs>`
or a combination of training and test set, you can integrate it easily by defining it in the
:mod:`~pySPACE.missions.nodes` package.
Otherwise you will have to integrate it into the
:mod:`~pySPACE.missions.operations` package, which is also a subpackage of the
:mod:`~pySPACE.missions` package.
Last but not least, you may want to write only a wrapper for your algorithm and
even implement your algorithm in a different language like C++ or even Matlab.
So the wrapper is integrated as mentioned before and the real algorithm
implementation can be done in the :mod:`~pySPACE.missions.support` package.

If you should realize, that this software is unable to load, store or
process your special type of data, you should have a look into the
:mod:`~pySPACE.resources` package.
Here different stages of accumulation of data are defined,
but most probably, you will be interested in
:mod:`~pySPACE.resources.dataset_defs`.
Very likely you will not have to define a complete new dataset type but
only add the functionality you need to the existing ones.

When integrating new components you should als write small
:mod:`~pySPACE.tests.unittests` in :mod:`~pySPACE.tests`.

In case you need some of the :mod:`~pySPACE.tools` please have a look at the 
respective documentation, too. This is also true for 
:mod:`~pySPACE.environments` similar holds, e.g., if you want to implement
new :mod:`backend <pySPACE.environments.backends>`
or have an own :mod:`~pySPACE.environments.live` application.

The following methods constitute the interface of the package:

    .. autosummary::
        :nosignatures:

        load_configuration
