class AdaptiveThresholdPreprocessingNode(BaseNode):
    """ Setting adaptive threshold as described by Semmaoui, H., etal. (2012)
    
    This node can be used to threshold a continuous signal with a adaptive threshold.
    The advantage over a simple fixed threshold method is the adaption to the signal.
    For example if a sensor value drifts over time either in positive or negative 
    direction, a fixed threshold method can have big problems with this one. For 
    a negative drift the "zero" value may get so low that the fixed threshold is 
    never reached again, the other way round a positive drift can lead to a continuous 
    overcoming of the fixed threshold. The adaptive threshold is based on the following
    publication:
    
    Semmaoui, H., etal. (2012).
    Setting adaptive spike detection threshold for smoothed TEO based on robust statistics theory.
    IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 59(2):474 - 482.
    (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=06070974)

    The formula is given as:
    
    .. math:: T(t) = mean(t)_N + p*std(t)_N, 
    
    where T(t) is the threshold at a given timepoint t, mean(t)_N is the mean at 
    timepoint t calculated over the last N samples p is the sensitivity factor and 
    std(t)_N is the standard deviation at timepoint t calculated over the last N 
    samples.
    
    
    The processing is split into two parts, this node implements the first part 
    which does the actual thresholding and safes a timeseries containing zeros, 
    accept at those timepoints where the signal exceeded the threshold. NOTICE 
    only the very first timepoint where the signal overcame the threshold is 
    marked with the value 1 all other values remain a zero. In a second step 
    see "AdaptiveThresholdClassifierNode" below the results are transfered into 
    prediction vectors. This is done since the threshold methods needs the whole 
    data in order to continuously calculate the mean and std. dev., otherwise the 
    first N samples of each window could not be used for analysis. IMPORTANT the 
    preprocessing has to be done without any windowing accept the NULL marker, 
    with a fixed nullmarkerstride.
    
    **Parameters**
    
        :width_adaptiveThreshold:
            Specifies the width of the window used for calculating the mean and 
            the standard deviation for the threshold in ms
            
            (*optional, default:2000*)
        
        :p_adaptiveThreshold:
            Specifies the p for the adaptive threshold
                
            (*optional, default:8*)
                
        :time_below_threshold:
            Specifies how long the signal has to be below the signal before a new 
            thresholding is allowed in ms. This is helpful if only the beginning 
            of some event should be detected in the signal.
            
            (*optional, default:1000*)
