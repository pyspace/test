    """ Show a 2d scatter plot of all :class:`~pySPACE.resources.data_types.feature_vector.FeatureVector` based on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) from MDP
    
    This node collects all training examples it obtains along with their
    label. It computes than an embedding of all these examples in a 2d space
    using the "Locally Linear Embedding" algorithm and plots a scatter plot of
    the examples in this space.
    
    **Parameters**
    
        :neighbors:
            The number of neighbor vectors that should be considered for each
            instance during locally linear embedding
            
            (*optional, default: 15*)

                neighbors : 10
        -
            node : Nil_Sink

    Known Issues:
    This node will use pylab.show() to show the figure. There is no store
    method implemented yet. On Macs, pylab.show() might sometimes fail due to
    a wrong plotting backend. A possible workaround in that case is to
    manually set the plotting backend to 'MacOSX'. This has to be done before
    pylab is imported, so one can temporarily add "import matplotlib;
    matplotlib.use('MacOSX')" to the very beginning of launch.py.
