    This node implements the basic framework for nodes that select sensors.
    The train method has to be overwritten as it is the place for the specific
    selection procedures and criteria.
    
    **Parameters**
          :num_selected_sensors: Determines how many sensors are kept.
          
                    (*optional, default: 2*)
          
          :store:   In contrary to the base node, the default of this node
                    is to store the chosen sensors and rankings.

                    If the store parameter is set to True, one file named
                    "sensor_selection.txt" will be saved.
                    This text file holds the list of
                    chosen sensors with no particular order. If the
                    SensorSelectionRankingNode is used, another file called
                    "ordered_list_of_picks.txt" will be saved.
                    This is an ordered list of the
                    picks that were made due to the ranking.
                    E.g., in a "remove_1" setting, the
                    first sensor in the list is the first that was removed.
                    In a "add_1" setting it is the first one that was added.
                    Additionally, one file called "sensor_ranking.txt"
                    will be created. This file is a merge of the aforementioned.
                    The first entries are the selected channels
                    that can't be ranked
                    in alphabetical order.
                    Then come the (de-)selected sensors in order of
                    descending relevance. 
                    
                    (*optional, default: True*)

    The following shows a complete example using the
    SensorSelectionRankingNode to illustrate, how nodes of this type
    can be used. In this case, the number of sensors is first reduced to 8
    removing 2 sensors at a time, than increased back to 16 adding 4 at a
    time.

class SensorSelectionRankingNode(SensorSelectionBase):
    """ Iteratively choose sensors depending on a ranking function
    
    This node collects the training data and generates a ranker. Then it
    evaluates different sub-/supersets of the current set of sensors using
    this ranker, and dismisses or adds sensors according to the ranking result. 
    
    The ranking function can (and often will) in fact consist of the evaluation
    of an entire classification flow. After that, e.g., achieved performance or
    the values of certain classifier parameters can be used as ranking.
    See the PerformanceRanker and CoefficientRanker classes for details.

    .. note::
        The code of this node is partly copied from parameter optimization node.
    
    **Parameters**
        :num_selected_sensors: Determines how many sensors are kept.
          
          :ranking: String specifying the desired method for the ranking of
              sensors. The string must be known to the create_ranker method.
              So far implemented:
              
              * "Remove_One_Performance_Ranking"
                  Based on the current set of sensors, the ranking of one
                  sensor is computed by removing it and evaluating the
                  performance based on the remaining sensors. The
                  classification node chain has to be specified. One would
                  typically use this together with a "remove_*" ranking_spec
                  (see below) to implement a "recursive backwards
                  elimination".
                  
              * "Add_One_Performance_Ranking"
                  This Ranker takes the current set as fixed and extends it by
                  previously dismissed sensors. This implementation gains
                  access to the previously dismissed channels through the
                  data.history. Thus, in order for this to work, make sure
                  that a previous node in the flow (that works on a larger set 
                  of sensors) has set "keep_in_history : True". See the
                  example flow in the documentation of SensorSelectionBase.
                  The current set of sensors plus one of the dismissed
                  sensors will be evaluated. This will be repeated for each
                  of the previously dismissed sensors. The ranking results
                  from the classification performance. One would typically use
                  this together with a "add_n" ranking_spec to re-add the n best
                  performing sensors.
                  
              * "Coefficient_Ranking" 
                  performs a classification flow (which has
                  to be specified in ranking_spec) using all currently active 
                  sensors. The actual ranking is then provided by the
                  classifier's get_sensor_ranking method.
          
          :ranking_spec: Arguments passed to the ranker upon creation. Often
              contains a classification flow of some sort.
              
          :recast_method: Determines how the set of sensors is altered based
              on the ranking. Most commonly, the worst sensor will be removed
              until the desired number of sensors is reached. Alternatively,
              n sensors at a time could be removed. When using
              "Add_One_Performance_Ranking" sensors can even be added. Syntax
              is {add/remove}_n, e.g., add_3, remove_4.
              
              NB: When performing performance ranking, remove_* should be used
                  only together with the Remove_One_Performance_Ranking, and
                  add_* should only be used with Add_One_Performance_Ranking.
              
              (*optional, default: remove_1*)

    This node searches for an optimal sensor configuration for a given number

    algorithms or recursive backward elimination) for this search. The
    objective function that shall be maximized can be configured
    and is based on the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio (SSNR).
    
    **Parameters**
          :erp_class_label: Label of the class for which an ERP should be evoked. 
               For instance "Target" for a P300 oddball paradigm.
    
          :num_selected_sensors: Determines how many sensors are kept.

          :retained_channels: The number of pseudo-channels that are kept after 
                xDAWN filtering when using virtual sensor space. 
                Even though this node only selects sensors 
                and does no spatial filtering, this information is relevant since
                the SSNR after xDAWN spatial filtering is used in objective 
                functions in virtual sensor space and the SSNR depends 
                on the number of pseudo-channels. If one does not use virtual
                sensor space, this information can be ignored.
                
                (*optional, default: num_selected_sensors*)
              
          :search_heuristic: The search heuristic that is used to search an
              optimal sensor configuration. Can be either "evolutionary_search"
              or "recursive_backward_elimination".
              
              (*optional, default: "evolutionary_algorithm"*)
              
          :objective_function: The objective function that is used to determine
               which sensor selection are well suited and which less suited.
               Available objective functions are "ssnr_vs" (the signal to 
               signal-plus-noise ratio in virtual sensor space), "ssnr_as" 
               (the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio in actual sensor space),
               "ssnr_vs_loeo" (the minimum signal to signal-plus-noise ratio 
               in virtual sensor space when one of selected sensors wouldn't
               be present)
                
                (*optional, default: "ssnr_vs"*)
                
          :population_size: The number of individuals of which one generation 
                of the EA consists of. Each individual corresponds to one 
                sensor configuration.
                
                (*optional, default: 20*)
                
          :num_survivors: The number of individuals which survive at the end of
                a generation of the EA. The ratio of num_survivors to population_size 
                determines the selection pressure.
                
                (*optional, default: *8*)
                
          :mutant_ratio: The ratio of the next generation that consist of
                survivors that a underwent a mutation.
                
                (*optional, default: *0.3*)
          
          :crossover_ratio: The ratio of the next generation that consist of
                offspring of two survivors that were crossovered.
                
                (*optional, default: *0.3*)

          :iterations: The number of sensor configurations that are evaluated 
              before the EA terminates. The larger this value, the better 
              performance (higher SSNR) can be expected but the computation time

class PerformanceRanker(object):
    """ Rank sensors by performance after evaluating classification flows
    
    This class provides the functionality to evaluate different classification
    flows. Every flow has an sensor_identifier string associated.
    Afterwards, the classification performances (or a derived value - see 
    std_weight parameter) are sorted and returned together with the associated
    identifier. 
    
    .. note:: Classification performances are multiplied with (-1).
              In this way, high performances appear first in the sorted results.
    
    The flows differ in the sensors/channels that are used by using
    multiple Channel Name Selection (CNS) nodes. The way how these CNS nodes are
    generated, however, is specific for every particular selection procedure
    (such as "remove one backwards elimination" vs. "add one forward assembly").
    The actual generation of the flows happens in generate_cns_nodes. This
    template class only has a dummy for that method - overwrite it in your
    ranker! See RemoveOnePerformanceRanker or AddOnePerformanceRanker for
    examples.
    
    **Parameters**
        :flow: The processing chain (YAML readable). Usually, the flow
            will at least consist of a CV-Splitter, a classifier, and a
            :class:`~pySPACE.missions.nodes.sink.classification_performance_sink.ClassificationPerformanceSink`.
            See the documentation of :class:`SensorSelectionBase` for an example.

        :metric: The :ref:`metric <metrics>`
            for the classification performance used for
            the calculation of the ranking,
            if a performance value is used.

            (*optional, default: Balanced_accuracy*)

        :std_weight:
            As a result of cross validation often more than one
            performance result (*p*) per sensor set is calculated.
            The score (*s*) of one particular constellation is thus computed
            by calculating

            .. math:: s = mean(p) - \\text{std\_weight} \\cdot \\text{std\_dev}(p)

            Hence, for std_weight = 0 the mean is used. With increasing
            std_weight large spreads get penalized more strongly.

            (*optional, default: 0*)

        :runs: May be specified to perform multiple runs (and thus different
            CV-Splits)

            (*optional, default: 1*)

        :pool_size: May be specified to achieve parallelization of the
            classification subflow as normally only the main flow is parallelled.

            .. note:: Currently a pool size larger than 1 will not work with the MulticoreBackend,
                      because multiprocessing can't be nested.
                      Use loadl backend instead or no pool size!

            .. todo:: Distribute subflows with the subflowhandler using backend specific parallelization.
