    """ Common Spatial Pattern filtering
    
    A node that implements the supervised common spatial pattern
    algorithm for spatial filtering as described in
    http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4408441
    
    The ordering of classes in this implementation is done in alphabetic order.
    This means when having the classes 'Target' and 'Standard',
    that the first channel is the best for 'Standard' and the last one the best
    for 'Targets', since the first one is the one with the highest eigenvalue.
    
    To unify this spatial filter with other spatial filters for the final filter
    we arranged the channels in alternating order, meaning first, last, second,
    last but one, third, last but two, ... .
    This is done, such that the ordering of filters is according to importance
    of the filter, which is important, when deciding, which channels to choose.
    Nevertheless the channel names still correspond to the ordering of the
    eigenvalues.

    **Parameters**
        :retained_channels: Determines how many of the CSP pseudo channels
            are retained. Default is None which means "all channels".

            (*optional, default: None*)

        :relevant_indices: Determines on which time indices the CSP filters
            are trained. Default is None which means "all time index".

            (*optional, default: None*)

        :spatio_temporal: If this parameter is true, each sample
            is considered as a separate channel.
            This means that a time window with 64 channels and 25 observations 
            is transformed into a time window with 64*25 channels with one 
            observation.
            After filtering, the data is  retransformed into a 64x25 time window.

            (*optional, default: False*)

        :load_path: An absolute path from which the CSP patterns can be
            loaded. If not specified, these patterns are learned from the training data.

            (*optional, default: None*)

        :visualize_pattern: If value is true, a visualization of the learned CSP
            is stored. Therefore the parameter store needs to be set to true also.

            (*optional, default: False*)
