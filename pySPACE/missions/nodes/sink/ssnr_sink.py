class SSNRSinkNode(BaseNode):
    """ Sink node that collects SSNR metrics in actual and virtual sensor space.

    This sink node computes metrics based on the signal to signal-plus-noise
    ratio (SSNR). It computes the SSNR both in actual sensor space (ssnr_as)
    and virtual sensor space (ssnr_vs). For virtual sensor space, it computes
    additionally the SSNR on unseen test data (if available), meaning that the
    mapping to virtual sensor space is computed on training data and the
    SSNRis computed on test data that was not used for learning this mapping.

    **Parameters**
          :erp_class_label: Label of the class for which an ERP should be evoked.
               For instance "Target" for a P300 oddball paradigm.

          :retained_channels: The number of channels that are retained after
               xDAWN-based spatial filtering. The SSNR is computed in the
               virtual sensor space consisting of these retained channels.
               This quantity is only relevant for the SSNR metrics that are
               computed in the virtual sensor space. If this quantity is not
               defined, all channels are retained

              (*optional, default: None*)

    .. todo:: It would be desirable to compute the SSNR within a node chain and write
              it along with other metrics in a result file in a later sink node.
              This could work the following way: Write the SSNR metrics in
              BaseData type, and read these in the
              :class:`~pySPACE.missions.nodes.sink.classification_performance_sink.PerformanceSinkNode`.
              A further sink node should be added that stores only metrics
              contained in BaseData type.
