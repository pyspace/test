Setup and build the eegmanager
******************************

This Tutorial describes, how to build and setup the eegmanager.
The eegmanager can be used to work with eeg-data originating
from a live recording session (*online*). 

Requirements
============

The EEGServer itself depends on several other software frameworks and/or 
packages. Before we start, download and install the following software 
on your system:

**Windows**

    0. You need a compiler for c-code. So please download and install the MinGW / MSYS tools.
    You can find them here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files
    
    - make sure, C++ compiler is checked in installation options
    - ignore the error saying "no valid w32api.h in MinGW"
    - add MinGW binary DIR to systems PATH variable (e.g. ``C:\MinGW\bin``)
    
    1. Qt4 and qmake. They are needed for the GUI and compilation. You can
    find an installer for windows here: http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-win-opensource-4.8.4-mingw.exe
    
    - reference your MinGW location during installation (e.g. ``C:\MinGW\``)
    - add Qt binary DIR to systems PATH variable (e.g. ``C:\Qt\4.8.4\bin``)
    
    2. Python. Python is needed for running the GUI. You can find 
    a Python MSI here: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi

    - add Python binary DIR to systems PATH (e.g. ``C:\Python27``)

    3. The yaml package is needed for the GUI as well: http://pyyaml.org/download/pyyaml/PyYAML-3.10.win32-py2.7.exe
    That python is able to use the Qt-GUI elements also the pyQT bindings
    have to be installed. You can find an installer here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.10/PyQt4-4.10-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.4-x32.exe
    
    4. If you want to record live data you have to have an BrainProducts EEG-System
    consisting of the USB-Adapter, an Amplifier and a Cap-System. Also the driver
    for the USB-Adapter has to be installed on the host computer. This is usually done
    by installing the *BrainVision Recorder* software by BrainProducts.

**Mac, Linux**

    0. You need a compiler for c-code. Get it via a package manager of your choice. 
    On Macs you can also install the developer tools (aka XCode) to obtain a C(lang)-Compiler. 
    If you already have a compiler installed you are good to go and can proceed to the next
    step.

    1. Qt4 Tools and Libraries (for qmake and the GUI components). A Tutorial for 
    downloading can be found <`here <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/installation.html>`_>.
    Also, you can find the Qt4 libraries in the package manager on your system.
    For example on a mac (with port installed) type.
 
    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo port install qt4-mac
     
    2. If you not already done it, install python, py-yaml and the pyQt4
    bindings. Make sure, all the packet use the same python version (e.g. 2.6),
    the python-version is in your path and is the default version.
    
    3. Make sure that all executables are accessible by your current environment
    by modifying the path variable.


Building the eegmanager
=======================

    Navigate to the eegmanagers source directory.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        cd ${pyspace}/pySPACE/tools/live/eegmanager

    Invoke the qmake command there.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        qmake

    The software project uses the SUBDIRS template because also some 
    dependencies (in *deps*) have to be built before the eegmanager.
    After qmake finished run make.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        make

    After the compilation finished the executable is located in 
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        ${pyspace}/pySPACE/tools/live/eegmanager/eegmanager and is also 
        
    called ``eegmanager`` or ``eegmanager.exe`` respective.
 

Using the eegmanager
====================

    The control of the eegmanager is achieved by sending remote-procedure-calls
    to the running executable. Dont worry, you dont have to do it yourself on
    the terminal. Instead there is a GUI application, which lets you interact 
    with the eegmanager easily and shows you the current status of the running
    application.

    To start the GUI navigate to the gui subfolder and launch it with python.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        cd ${pyspace}/pySPACE/tools/live/eegmanager/gui
        python eegmanager_gui.py

    You will see something like this:

    .. figure::  ../graphics/eegmanager_mac.jpg
        :align:   center

        The unconfigured GUI on a Mac.

    The left pane lists available modules to use with the eegmanager. They are 
    ordered from modules, which are the source of data (e.g. *NETAcquisition*) on the top
    and modules, which comsumes data (e.g. *NETOutput*) at the bottom. 

    Once you set up the GUI to your needs you can save the current setup by
    pressing *command+s* or via the menu to a ``.egm`` file. This file can later
    be opened to quickly return to where you left. Under the hood these files
    are binary python-pickle dumps which contain data in the yaml format.

    For debugging purposes another view can be enabled by clicking on
    ``Window->Console``. The Console-windows displays the stdout from the underlying 
    process. Normally there will be only some informational messages but
    when some abnormal behaviour is observed please feel free to have look
    in there. For performance reasons the output is only refreshed when the
    ``refresh`` button at the bottom is clicked.
 
Data recording
==============

    One simple application of the eegmanager is the recording of
    data. Currently only the BrainProducts Amplifiers are supported
    via the access to the Windows driver and the USB-Adapter or
    PCI-Card.

    After you compiled the eegmanager successfully on a windows machine
    after launching the GUI you will see something like this:

    .. figure::  ../graphics/eegmanager_win.png
        :align:   center

        The unconfigured GUI on Windows XP

    For online access to the data drag the list item which says
    *BPAcquisition* onto the left of the window.

    For recording the data to a file add the *FILEOutput* item. 
    The configured GUI should then look like this:

    .. figure::  ../graphics/eegmanager_win_configured.png
        :align:   center

        The configured GUI for recording on Windows XP

    Pressing the *start* buttont starts the execution of the eegmanager and
    records the data. Dont forget to fill in the parameters such as the 
    desired resolution, the directory where the data gets saved and the filename.

    If something goes wrong (e.g. the USB-Adapter can not be found) you will get
    notified by a small red cross next the module in error. By clicking on it a
    pop-up will print some of the output related to the error.

    .. figure::  ../graphics/eegmanager_win_error.png
        :align:   center

        Example for an error while configuring the eegmanager
    
Data streaming
==============
 
    Streaming data in principle works like recording. The only difference
    is, that the module, which consumes the data gets replaced by the
    *NETOutput* modlue. This module forwards the data via a network connection.
    The network data stream can then be used to process the data with pySPACE-live.

    .. figure::  ../graphics/eegmanager_win_streaming.png
        :align:   center

        Simple streaming setup

    For connecting both applications note the current IP-Address of the computer
    which runs the streaming. Configure the port number in the GUI to fit your 
    needs. Add this information (IP-Address, Port) to you pySPACE-live parameter
    file and the data should get received.
 

Conclusion
==========

    We built the eegmanager and have learned how to acquire data.
    The data can be recorded directly but can also be forwarded to another
    computer on the network to get processed or recorded there.
