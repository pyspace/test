.. _tutorial_node_chain:

Process EEG data (only) from within a Python session
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we will learn how to use pySPACE from within a Python shell
without explicitly using the whole functionality of pySPACE.
Here, we get the "data pieces" from a pySPACE data generator with which we 
perform the specified node chain and get the results.
Therefore, it has to be underlined that we still have to use a bit
:mod:`~pySPACE.resources` to provide the node chain with the correct data.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we start, some prerequisites have to be fulfilled:

 1. Download and install pySPACE as it is described
    :ref:`here<t_install>`.
 2. The example data can be found in the storage of the pySPACEcenter under eeg_examples.
    There you will find the Folder "test_data/Set1". The node_chain and the windower file 
    needed in this tutorial are located in the specs folder of the pySPACEcenter. These
    are two .yaml files named *example_tutorial_eeg_only.yaml* and *windower/example_tutorial_eeg_only_window.yaml*
 3. To make things easier, your PYTHONPATH variable should contain the path to
    pySPACE. E.g. consider your framework folder to be in
    "/home/user/software/": You can
    either change your .bash_profile by adding:
    ::
    
        export PYTHONPATH=/home/user/software/:$PYTHONPATH

    or by starting your Python session (or script) with:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        import sys
        sys.path.append('/home/user/software/')

Data Inspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step in every investigation is of course to get some knowledge about
the data you are investigating. The test data is in the *Set1* folder, stored in
a binary .eeg file. It consists of 32-channels which all "measured" a sinusoid
signal and you have two markers "R 32" and "R 64" in the data. Using an 
eeg-Fileviewer, the data looks like this:

.. figure:: ../graphics/example_data_sinus.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 800 px
   :width: 800

   Test data: shown is the progress over time (time between dashed lines equals
   1 second) including the channel names as they would occur in a real EEG
   experiment. Markers are illustrated at the bottom. They label important events.

Three other files exist in the data folder: The files ending with .vhdr and .vmrk
directly belong to the .eeg file specifying additional information. In contrast to
the actual data, they are not in a binary format, so you can open them with a
text editor if you are curious. 
The vhdr-file contains general additional information and the vmrk file contains
name and time point of the markers you see above.

The last file, named *metadata.yaml* is mandatory for loading data.
It contains some general information (to get an idea of what you can
specify in the metadata.yaml see :ref:`here<datasets>`). The format of the file
is `YAML <http://www.yaml.org>`_, which was developed as a human readable 
(i.e. in text format) data format. The YAML format is widely used in the software.
For the moment, you do not need to care about the *metadata.yaml*, but its
presence already indicates how the data will be loaded: with the help of pySPACE.
More details on YAML can be found :ref:`here <yaml>`.

Now let us look at the node chain and how to start it:

The First Node Chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As introduced above, the files are located after installation in the specs folder of
your pySPACEcenter. Relevant are the two YAML files: *example_tutorial_eeg_only.yaml* 
contains the processing sequence for the data
and *windower/example_tutorial_eeg_only_window.yaml* contains
some information how the data should be cut relative to the markers and how this
data should be labeled. This file is only necessary here, because we are dealing
with raw EEG data, which -as a first step- has to be windowed. You can open and look at
it, the definitions are more or less self explaining (you can find a bit more 
information on windowing in the general:ref:`node chain tutorial<tutorial_node_chain_operation>`).

Now let us look at the processing sequence. If you open *example_tutorial_eeg_only.yaml* you
will see the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/specs/node_chains/example_tutorial_eeg_only.yaml
    :language: yaml

This is the node chain that defines how the data is treated. In every node, the data is
processed and passed to the next node, until finished (for more information on available nodes 
see :mod:`node documentation <pySPACE.missions.nodes>`).
Here, e.g., the data is  detrended, its
sampling frequency decimated and finally bandpass-filtered between 0 Hz and 10 Hz.
The *Source* and *Sink* nodes deal with loading and saving of the data.
By convention, when using launch in the run environment, every node chain should **start with a source
node** and **end with a sink node**.

The path given here is just an example. Therefore, 
before executing, you should adjust the path of the windowing spec file according to your own.

Running the NodeChain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let us import the software and run the node chain!
You can do the following either in a Python session
or by writing and executing a script. 

As a first step, we import everything that is necessary:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from pySPACE.environments.chains.node_chain import NodeChainFactory
    from pySPACE.environments.chains.node_chain import BenchmarkNodeChain
    from pySPACE.resources.dataset_defs.base import BaseDataset

The YAML file is converted to an executable NodeChain with the NodeChainFactory.
The BenchmarkNodeChain
was written to execute **offline data**
and the :mod:`~pySPACE.resources` package is used to collect
the necessary information concerning the underlying data,
i.e. the so called *dataset*.

Second, we define necessary directories and location of the NodeChain
(please adjust the paths accordingly):

.. code-block:: python
    
    node_chain='/home/user/pySPACEcenter/specs/node_chains/example_tutorial_eeg_only.yaml'
    data_dir='/home/user/pySPACEcenter/storage/eeg_examples/test_data/Set1/'
    store_dir='/home/user/pySPACEcenter/storage/myresults/'

The *store_dir* specifies where the data should be stored to disk. As a next step,
we have to read the text from the YAML file:

.. code-block:: python
    
    pyspacespecfile=open(node_chain)
    pyspacespec=pyspacespecfile.read()
    pyspacespecfile.close()

Now a valid node chain is created with the given specifications.
The necessary functions
for execution are defined by the class in the module
:mod:`~pySPACE.environments.chains.node_chains` (in this case *BenchmarkNodeChain*).
Here, you might get a warning which you can ignore.

.. code-block:: python
    
    my_flow = NodeChainFactory.flow_from_yaml(Flow_Class=BenchmarkNodeChain, flow_spec=pyspacespec)

As introduced above, the data is loaded with the help of :mod:`~pySPACE.resources`
and the corresponding *metadata.yaml* file. This is done in the next step:

.. code-block:: python
    
    input_dataset = BaseDataset.load(data_dir)

Now the data is processed and the result is stored in the variable *result*,
which has a data type that is defined in pySPACE and comes with its own store method.
By calling this method, the data is stored to disk in the appropriate data format:

.. code-block:: python
    
    result = my_flow.benchmark(input_collection = input_dataset, persistency_directory = store_dir, run=1)
    result.store(store_dir)

In principle, you can use more than one set (=run) for your evaluation, but again you have to 
specify how to deal with these, e.g., how to deal with the numbering. As you already may
have guessed, this is been shaded for the user when using the software. Thus, you should
not worry about the argument *run=1* for now.

Curious on what you have done?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since you've seen already in the spec file how the data is processed, the answer might be a
little bit disappointing: besides that it is windowed, the data is nearly the same.
Nevertheless you can play around a bit with the stored data to get an idea of how
it is generally stored as long as it is a *TimeSeries*.
To do this, you can start with the following code in your *store_dir* and go on as you like...

.. code-block:: python
    
    import cPickle
    import pylab as pl
    
    data=cPickle.load('time_series_sp0_test.pickle')
    first_elem=data[0][0]
    
    print first_elem.tag
    print first_elem.channel_names
    
    pl.plot(first_elem[:,0]) #plot data of first electrode
