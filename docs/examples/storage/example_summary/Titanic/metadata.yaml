    The IDA Version of this dataset
    http://mldata.org/repository/data/viewslug/titanic-ida/
    is somehow broken, as it has only 24 instances.
    
    Therefore, we used the dataset available at
    http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/titanic/desc.html
    and transformed as follows:
        
        adult -> 1.0
        child -> -1.0
        
        male -> 1.0
        female -> -1.0
        
        1st -> 4.0
        2nd -> 3.0
        3rd -> 2.0
        crew -> 1.0
        
        survived -> Standard
        dead -> Target
