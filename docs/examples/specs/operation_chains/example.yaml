# An example of an operation chain specification file.
# The input used for the operation chain is specified as the value of
# "input_path", and the sequence of operations as value of "operations"
# In this example, first the operation specified in 
# "example_operation1.yaml" would be executed directly on example_data.
# The result would act as input for the operation
# specified in "example_operation2.yaml". The output of
# this operation would be the output of the whole operation chain.
# *runs* specifies how often the whole procedure is repeated for different
# random seeds. This is useful when randomized components are contained
# like crossvalidation splitters etc.
