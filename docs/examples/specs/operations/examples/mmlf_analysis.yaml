parameters: ["gamma", "epsilon", "lambda"] 

# We are interested in the two simple metrics "accumulated_reward" and "offline_accumulated_reward"
# and in the sequence of rewards obtained during learning and testing.
metrics: 
    - ["reward", "sequence", {'mwa_window_length': 25}]
    - "accumulated_reward"
