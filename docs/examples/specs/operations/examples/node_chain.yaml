# An example of a *node_chain* specification file.
# The specified input is the value of the entry
# with the key "input_path", the templates the value of "templates".
# This template is parametrized with two parameters called
# "__LOWER_CUTOFF__", and "__UPPER_CUTOFF__". Optionally, some "constraints"
# on the allowed parameter combinations can be defined. For instance,
# the constraint "__LOWER_CUTOFF__ < __UPPER_CUTOFF__" prevents that
# the combination where both __LOWER_CUTOFF__ and __UPPER_CUTOFF__ are 2.0
# is tested. For each combination of the given values for these two parameters
# that fulfills all constraints and the datasets of the
# input summary, one result dataset is created. This result dataset
# consists of the results of 10 independent runs with the
# instantiated template performed to the respective input dataset.
# Each such run is an independent process.

# The optional parameter "backend" allows to overwrite the backend specification provided
# via the command-line. This is useful if the operation is part of a chain
# and different operations of the chain should
# not be executed on the same modality.
