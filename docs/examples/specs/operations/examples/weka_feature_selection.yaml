# An example of a WekaFilter-Operation specification file. The specified
# input is the value of the entry with the key "input_path". The weka
# template is one of the available templates stored in specs/operations/weka_templates/,
# here for example "feature_selection".

type: weka_filter

input_path: "tutorial_data"

template: feature_selection

# Parameters to specify the feature selection can be set here.
# "feature_selector" specifies the evaluation method and "ranker"
# the search method of the feature selection. "num_retained_features" is the 
# number of attributes that will be kept after the filtering and reflects
# to the reduction of attributes.
# Note that 'chi_squared' or 'ranker' are abbreviation which must be defined
# in abbreviations.yaml and correspond to specific weka classes.
parameter_ranges:
    # e.g. chi_squared, info_gain, gain_ratio, relief, CFS
    feature_selector: ['chi_squared','info_gain','gain_ratio','relief'] 
    ranker: ['ranker'] # e.g. ranker, greedy_stepwise, best_firstn
    num_retained_features: [10] # -1 means all features are retained

# "hide_parameters" means, that this parameters will not be mapped to 
# the directory names in the result structure {parameter_name/parameter-value}.
# This is suggestive e.g. when only one parameter value is used.
hide_parameters: ['ranker','num_retained_features']
