# This is the standard default configuration file.
# Each possible parameter is mentioned here and its default value.
# Normally the default is quite useful und you won't have to change something,
# especially, when using the pySPACEcenter default configuration file.

# ===================
# = Main Parameters =
# ===================
# These parameters are the most important for pySPACE.
# The others are only relevant for special components.

# The directory from which data is loaded and stored to.
# To specify this directory is very very important.
# Default: $home_dir/pySPACEcenter/storage
storage:    ~/pySPACEcenter/storage
# The directory in which the configuration/specification files for operations, 
# operation chains, WEKA and pySPACE related options are stored.
# Default: $home_dir/pySPACEcenter/specs
spec_dir:    ~/pySPACEcenter/specs/
# The minimum level, log message must have to be printed to the stdout.
# Levels are based on the python logging package
# possible levels are logging.{DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, ERROR, FATAL}
# When using backends like the loadl backend the stdout is redirected to a file.
# If you get to much output, just use 'logging.CRITICAL'.
console_log_level:      logging.WARNING
# The minimum level, log message must have to be written to the operation log file.
# This file can be then found in your currently result folder.
# Be careful, that the file can get quite large when using DEBUG or INFO.
file_log_level:         logging.INFO
# The python path that should be used during the experiment
# Paths normally available in python do not have to be mentioned
# This part of setting paths is especially good to use alternative libraries,
# since the paths here get priority.
# Default: empty list
# external_nodes: ["~/pySPACEcenter/external_nodes","/opt/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pySPACE_extra_nodes"]
#python_path:
#        - /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages
#        - /usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/
#        - /usr/lib/python2.5
#        - /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/
#        - /usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk/

# =========================
# = Node specific options =
# =========================

# If you want to have your own nodes outside the normal pySPACE structure
# this parameter lists external folders which where also scanned for nodes.
# Furthermore, the corresponding path is added to the local system path.
# Note, that still double naming is forbidden and crashes the software.
# See: pySPACE.missions.nodes.external
# external_nodes = [~/pySPACEcenter/external_nodes]

# ==============================
# = Operation specific options =
# ==============================

# WEKA operation
# The java class path used for WEKA
# weka_class_path:        ~weka-3-6-0/weka.jar:/home/user/weka-additional

# ============================
# = Backend specific options =
# ============================

# ===Local===

# Number of used CPUs for parallelization.
# By default the total number of available CPUs is used.
# pool_size : 1

# ===LoadLeveler===
# Specify parameters for the loadl backend for the cluster.
#
# Class name of your committed jobs. Default is 'general'.
# Depending on the class and the configuration of the cluster
# jobs with more important class name get a higher priority
job_class: general # one of [ critical, general, longterm]
# Maximal memory one process will use, since this should be known by the 
# scheduler to appropriately start more jobs or NOT. The value only effects
# the scheduling (loadleveler) but not the system, so nothing will happen to
# your jobs if they exceed the specified value.
# Default is set to the available memory divided by the number of CPUs of one
# blade (3250mb). If you do not expect such large memory, decrease the value.
consumable_memory: 3250mb # number and unit (gb,mb,kb)
# Maximal number of CPUs one job needs, since this should be known by the 
# scheduler to appropriately start more jobs or NOT. The value only effects
# the scheduling (loadleveler) but not the system, so nothing will happen to
# your jobs if they exceed the specified value.
# The default is 1.
consumable_cpus: 1
# optionally specify which nodes are used for calculation, e.g. 
# anodes: (Machine == "anode05.dfki.uni-bremen.de") || (Machine == "anode02.dfki.uni-bremen.de")


first_call : True # Internal Parameter for first call of software to give detailed information and welcome screen. It should remain at the last line!
